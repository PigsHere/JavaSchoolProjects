In ths billing system, I will use:

1. Variables --> To store static values let VAT% which is 13% as well as
                 to store the user's input such as their discount%, their
                 amount to be paid, their userID and password, etc.


2. Looping Statements --> To create a prompt to ask if the user wants to terminate the program
                          and to give the user his highest change in notes, or to let them know
                          that they have no change. And also to keep asking the user for the items'
                          names and prices till they stop.

3. Arrays --> To store various discount% which the user can use and to check if the discount amount given
              by the user exists and is usable to grant the user certain discount.

4. Variable Manipulation --> To simply calculate discount amount, vat amount, total price, total notes
                             and total change that the user is to receive.

5. Arraylist --> To store userIDs and verify if the userID and password given by the user matches or
                 exists within the array, and to either say that they are logged in, or to let them know
                 that their userID or password is incorrect and that that userID doesn't exist. And also to
                 store the prices of the items and check if the user's prices are accurate.
